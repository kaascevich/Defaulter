# ``PaneKit``

Generate user interfaces from property lists.

## Overview

Defaulter's support for custom panes allows users to optimize their workflow. With PaneKit, developers can do the same.

PaneKit is a general framework that allows you to generate UI layouts from property lists (or JSON, if that's your thing). It's optimized for preference panes -- such as the ones used in Defaulter -- but can theoretically be used to generate any sort of UI.
